        <h1 align="center"> STOCKS</h1>
        <p> A stock is an investment in a specific company. When you purchase a stock, you’re buying a share — a small piece — of that company’s earnings and assets.<br> Companies sell shares of stock in their businesses to raise cash.Investors can then buy and sell those shares among themselves.</p>
        <h2 align="center"> How investors make money?</h2>
        <p1>Stock investors make money when the value of the stock they own goes up and they’re able to sell that stock for a profit. Some stocks also pay dividends, which are regular distributions of a company’s earnings to investors.There are two primary ways to earn money from shares - through capital appreciation and from dividends.
         <br><br></p1>

        <h3> Earning from Dividends: </h3>
            <p2>The formula for computing the dividend yield is:<br>
                <f>Dividend Yield = Cash Dividend per share / Market Price per share * 100.</f><br>
                So, if the market price is Rs 120 and the dividend declared is Rs 4 per share, the dividend yield is 3.33 percent.

            However, when we take a look at the stocks that had the highest potential to bring wealth to investors over the past 20 years, we find that the list does not consist solely of tech giants like Amazon and Apple. In fact, some of them might surprise you, and some of them you might never have even heard of before.<br><br>
            stock markets that would have multiplied investors funds the most if they had been able to purchase them at the lowest price they traded at over the last 20 years and held the shares through today. The results are shown in the chart below, with all purchase prices properly
