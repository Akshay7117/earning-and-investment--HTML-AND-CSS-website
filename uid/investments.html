        <h2 align="center">BEFORE YOU START INVESTING</h2><br><br>
        <p class="before">Before you invest you obviously need some money saved up. <br><br>No, you don’t need thousands and thousands of dollars to get <br><br>started but it may help you in the long run to see more return on your investments.<br><br>
            If you’re currently living paycheck to paycheck investing might <br><br>not be a good option right now. If you’re finding that you’re <br><br>making enough money to pay your bills and more, you might consider it.</p><br><br>
        <h3 align="right" class="keep">KEEP EMERGENCY FUND</h3>
        <img src="emergency.jpg" alt="emergency_fund" align="left" class="emerg" border="3"><br><br>
        <p align="right" class="emerg_text">You should also consider keeping some emergency money aside for <br><br>unexpected matters that may arise. This money should forever be off limits<br><br> and only used in time of need.</p><br><br><br>
        <h2 align="center" class="buss">BUSINESS IN THE FRONT , PARTY IN THE BACK</h2><br><br>

            <p>In whichever manner you decide to do it, keep your finances separate.<br><br> 
                When your invoices come in, deposit them in your business account and when you buy groceries,
                <br><br> use your personal one, etc. By dividing your accounts and keeping your finances in 
                <br><br>the best order that they can be in, you’ll ensure that you’re not muddying the waters 
                <br><br>of how much you really earn. (Bonus: it is beyond helpful at tax time.)</p>

              <div class="text">Before you begin investing, you need to have a safety net in place.<br><br>
                For most people, a $500 to $1,000 mini-emergency fund will suffice, <br><br>
                but for freelancers, it’s advised to stash away three to six months worth of living
                expenses. <br><br>Because your income will fluctuate and little emergencies will pop 
                up, <br><br>you need this account in place</div>
